			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="../images/mypic.jpg" alt=Harrison>
			<p>
				I graduated from Troy University with a Bachelors in Applied Computer Science.  I also attended Georgia College and State University, where I played tennis.  Tennis has always been one of my biggest passions growing up.  I worked at a tennis specialty retail store for over a decade because of this passion.  I have recently left that job to pursue my other passion of Web development.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp to help further my knowledge and skills in Web development.  I also am married and have an eight month old son.  My wife is a teacher and the best person I know.  I never knew how becoming a father would change my life but now he just lights up my life.
